#Input Format
#The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
#Each test case contains two space-separated integers 
#X and Y â€” the numbers Chef and Chefina got on their respective dice.
#Output Format
#For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the turn was good and NO otherwise.
#Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is,
#the strings NO, no, nO, and No will be treated as equivalent.

#sample input           #sample output

#1 4                    no
#3 4                    yes
